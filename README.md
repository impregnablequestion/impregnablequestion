### Hi! I'm a software developer with a passion for fun, interactive solutions

- For an example of my work, visit [synthed](https://www.synthed.co.uk). It's a fun educational app designed to teach an absolute beginner the basics of using a synthesizer to make music ðŸŽ¹
- I recently completed the CodeClan professional software development course, and am now seeking a junior developer role. Get in touch [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamuslouisryan/) if you know of a role I might be interested in.
- I have been using Python, Javascript, TypeScript, Java, and the React framework but am currently learning C++ and JUCE for audio plugin development ðŸ’¿
